1. clone linked list having arbitrary pointer
2. LCA of 2 node in Binary tree and BST
3. There is a 2d array. Write code to find the path with maximum sum.
    You can only traverse i+1 or j+1

4. find max in bitonic array : [10,20,30,40,4,3,2,1] ==> answer = 40

5. find min diff b/ any 2 elements in array
    APPROACH : sort and find diff of all consecutive pairs


6.  Given an array of positive numbers, find the maximum sum of a subsequence
    with the constraint that no 2 numbers in the sequence should be adjacent in the array.
    (extended to negative numbers)

7. level-order traversal and level-order traversal in sprial form
8. check if tree is (a)BST , (b)Heap
9. encode string : aaabcdeeee : a3b1c1d1e4
10. print triplet whose product is maximum in a given array

11. given string some of the characters are replaced by question mark,
    and you can replace question mark with any character.
    Given such a string find total number of palindrome that can created.
    String contains only [a-z] characters and question marks can also be only replaced by [a-z].
    Example: Input String: String str=”a??a” Output: 26
    (is check if corresponding characters from both end match or not,
    if not : answer=0 , else each ? pair has 26 options)

12. merge n sorted linked list into a single sorted linked-list
13. determine if 2 trees are identical
14. convert tree to sum tree
15. left/right/top/bottom/boundary views of binary tree
16. count island in matrix (move 4 or move 8 adjacent cells)
17. next greater element (SOLUTION : using stacks)
18. Given a list of words followed by two words,
    the task to find the minimum distance between the given two words in the list of words

19. sort a linked list which is alternating ascending-descending order
    (seperate 2 list , reverse 2nd list , merge 2 list)

20. kth element from last in linked-list
    (kth from last = N-k+1 from beginning)

21. print all permutations of string (back-tracking)

22. minimum number of platforms , given arrival and departure of trains
23. pair with given target in BST
24. search in sorted rotated array
25. digit to words : 1234 ==> one thousand two hundred thirty four
26. swap list , by picking alternate first and last nodes : 1-2-3-4-5-6 ===> 1-6-2-5-3-4
27. check balanced paranthesis
28. sort an array of 0,1,2
29. clone binary tree with random pointers
    (using hashmap)

30. given an array , check if there exists 4-distinct numbers : a,b,c,d , such that a+b=c+d
    (using HASH-map)
    (store possible sum of 2 pairs as key and check if complement sum is present)

31. evaluate prefix and postfix expressions
32. convert string of alphabets to string of digits as in keypad phone : rat==>728

33. reverse linked-list in pairs of K

1. count inversions in an array
2. word ladder : given string1 , string2 and a dictionary  : find if its possible to go
    from string1 to string2 using only the wrods in dictionary
    (using BFS)

3. addition of numbers represented by linked-list (there are 2 variations to this problem)

4. given a matrix and a string : check if that sting occurs in matrix
    we can only move left,right,top,down
    (solve using DFS)

5. given an array and a number x : print all pais with product as x
    also handle duplicate pairs case
    (using hashmap)

6. Given an array A of N integers,
   find any 3 elements in it such that A[i] < A[j] < A[k] and i < j < k.
   TC=SC=n
   (using 2 extra arrays : storing left min and right max)

7. given binary tree , all leaf nodes are forming doubly linked list , find height of tree
   (criterial for checking leaf node will change :
   earlier we checked node.left==null && node.right==null
   now we will check node == node.left.right && node == node.right.left)

8. LRU cache

9. word frequency in stream of words
   (using tries)

10. Convert a Binary Search Tree into a Binary tree where value of
    each node in the tree is equal to sum of all nodes greater than it.
    (METHOD-1 : using auxillary array : do in-order , and find running sum from RHS , and then
    do another inorder to store list elements in tree)
    (METHOD-2 : reverse inorder , maintain global variable as running sum , only 1 traversal is required here)


11. given binary matrix , each row is sorted
    find row with maximum 1's
    (binary search on 1st row , the use a pointer : R + logC )

12. connect nodes at same level in Binary tree , using nextRight pointer

13. LIS DP variation using bridge cordinates

14. bridges and articulation points in graph

15. given 4 cordinates : representing diagonal of 2 rectangles
    find if reactangles overlap

16. merge 2 BST's ie. print elements in sorted order
    (expected space : h1+h2)
    (Solution : iterative inorder)

17. serialize/de-serialize a binary tree

18 trapping rain water

19. given 2 tree's root nodes , find if 2nd is subtree of another
    (Solution : get inorder and postorder string of both subtree ,
    now check sub-strings)

20. given a binary array and k : you can flip atmost k zeros
    find the length of longest substring of 1's after flip operation
    (using sliding window approach : window-size can expand only if zero-count is less/equal to k )

21. longest substring with k uniq chars (sliding window approach)


22. alien dictionary : order of words
    (topological sorting)


23. print all possible valid parenthesis
    (back-tracking)


24. next number using same digits : 12345 ==> 12354

25. longest palindromic sustring in a given string
    (DP[][] ... ij are starting and ending index)

1. next smallest palindrome : 12345 ==> 12421
2. min stack (extended to negative numbers)
3. stocks buy and sell : all variations
4. max ractangualar area in histogram  (using stack)
5. palindrome partioning of string : minimum cuts to make all substrings as palindromes
